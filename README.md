# React + TypeScript practice

## Getting Started with React

### Creating A react App

- Two known way to create React APp:

* Create react App (CRA)
  `Create React App` is a popular tool to quickly set up a React application with a basic configuration. It includes a build system, hot reloading, and more. It also supports TypeScript by default if you pass the `--template typescript` flag.

```
npx create-react-app
```

- vite
  Vite is a next-generation, fast build tool that is gaining popularity. It is faster than CRA in terms of development speed, and it also supports TypeScript out of the box.

To create a React app with Vite and TypeScript, run:

```
npm create vite@latest
```

### Project Stucture:

- `node_modules`:

  - Contains all the installed third-party dependencies such as React, ReactDOM, and other packages like TypeScript, Webpack, Babel, and various libraries (e.g., axios, react-router-dom, etc.).

  - This directory is automatically created when you run npm install or yarn install.

- `public`:

  - public assests of all website exist like images, videos, files etc..

- `src`:

  - The Source code of our components
  - This is where all your application code lives, including React components, styles, utility functions, hooks, and TypeScript files.
  - Typical subdirectories might include:
    - components/: React components (e.g., Button, Header, etc.).
    - styles/: CSS, SCSS, or styled-components files.
    - assets/: Image, font, or other static files used in your components.
    - utils/: Helper functions and utilities.
    - hooks/: Custom React hooks.
    - pages/: If using a router, this directory might contain different page components (e.g., Home, About, etc.).

- `index.html`:

  - containes a div with a ID of root which is the container of our application

- `package.json`:

  - This file holds metadata about the project and is a central place for managing dependencies, scripts, and project settings.
  - **Scripts**: Defines commands for running, building, testing, and linting your app (e.g., `npm start`, `npm run build`).
  - **Dependencies**: Lists all the npm packages the project depends on.
  - **DevDependencies**: Lists tools needed for development, such as Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.
  - **Main entry point**: Specifies the entry point (usually src/index.tsx for React TypeScript apps).

- `tsconfig.jsopn`:

  - TypeScript compiler configuration

- `vite.config.ts`:

  - TypeScript compiler configuration

### Creating a React Component

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from "eslint-plugin-react";

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: "18.3" } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs["jsx-runtime"].rules,
  },
});
```
